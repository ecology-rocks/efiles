# efiles

This is a simple text editor that I built using a tutorial, Angular, and electron. The "Start from scratch" button does not currently work because I've been playing with the dialog module. 

If you want to run this program, follow the reference here: [[https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/v0.36.3/docs/tutorial/quick-start.md]]

If you have electron installed already, you can "cd" to the correct directory and type "electron ." -- it should start up!
